# hyprsea_nvim_config

My current configuration for neovim
A cheatset will be added soon

## How to install

Navigate to `~/.config`. Then enter the command below :
```bash
git clone git@github.com:sohukia/hyprsea_nvim_config.git nvim
```

Start neovim, you should get an error saying that Gruvbox isn't found, just pass through and let neovim install its dependencies.
You can now close neovim, reopen it and you should have it nicely configured !
